# Striver A2Z DSA Sheet 🚀

This repository contains my solutions and notes as I progress through the [Striver A2Z DSA Sheet](https://takeuforward.org/strivers-a2z-dsa-course/strivers-a2z-dsa-course-sheet-2/). All implementations are done in **C++**, with organized code and supporting notes.

Sure! Here's a cleaner and simpler summary for **Day 1** that still looks professional:

---

### ✅ Day 1: C++ Basics & Conditionals

* Learned basic syntax, input/output, and data types.
* Practiced conditional statements: `if`, `else if`, `else`, and `switch`.
* Implemented beginner problems like positive/negative number check, even/odd check, vowel/consonant, and a basic calculator.
* Created and added an ASCII chart for quick reference.
