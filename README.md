# Striver A2Z DSA Sheet 🚀

This repository contains my solutions and notes as I progress through the [Striver A2Z DSA Sheet](https://takeuforward.org/strivers-a2z-dsa-course/strivers-a2z-dsa-course-sheet-2/). All implementations are done in **C++**, with organized code and supporting notes.

---


✅ Day 1: C++ Basics & Conditionals
Covered basic syntax, input/output, data types.

Implemented simple logic using if-else and switch-case statements.

Practiced common interview patterns like prefix/postfix increment and vowel checks.

Created ASCII chart cheat sheet for quick reference.

All programs are committed under Day1/ with detailed comments for future revision.
